# Task 4.15 - UI and UX Polish

## Objective
Introduce **UI and UX Polish** so the project evolves from a complete simulation into a polished, replayable, release-ready strategy game.

## Feature Increment
After this task, **UI and UX Polish** should improve depth, readability, replay value, or release completeness in a player-visible way.

## Detailed Requirements
Implement the scope below as production-ready game behavior rather than temporary UI-only placeholders.
- Improve layout quality and visual presentation.
- Add faster interactions and shortcuts.
- Improve information readability and display quality.
- Add data export features.
- Add game settings options.

## Code Design
- Preserve the earlier simulation contracts while layering content, UX, onboarding, and release-readiness around them.
- Use data-driven content definitions where possible so sect types, events, buildings, and achievements scale without hardcoding.
- Treat performance, saves, presentation, and release operations as production features, not late afterthoughts.
- Build screens around projections or view models that consume application services, not raw simulation internals.
- Keep navigation, filtering, and summary widgets aligned with player decisions so the UI explains cause and effect instead of only listing values.
- Treat readability, information hierarchy, and error states as part of the feature definition, not a later polish pass.

## Dependencies
- Build on Task 4.14 before implementation, and preserve all earlier loop guarantees for this phase.
- Keep the feature compatible with the phase exit standard described in README.md for this folder.

## Completion Signal
- The player-facing game loop can demonstrate **UI and UX Polish** without relying on placeholder-only behavior.
- State changes from this task are visible in the appropriate reports, panels, or simulation outputs.
- The feature improves content completeness, onboarding, replayability, or ship-readiness in a measurable way.
